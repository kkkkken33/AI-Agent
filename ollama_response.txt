Biden is a Democrat who served as Barack Obama’s 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 and previously represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009. From 1987 to 1995, he oversaw the Senate Judiciary Committee. During President Barack Obama’s Senate tenure, Biden wielded considerable power in foreign policy. The Vice President was the driving force behind the passing of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. We are here to help you celebrate the President’s special day.\n\n## Fast Facts\n\nFull Name:\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr.\n\nNickname:\n\nUncle-in-Chief, Amtrak Joe, Cup of Joe\n\nBirth date:\n\nNovember 20, 1942\n\nAge:\n\n82\n\nZodiac Sign:\n\nScorpio\n\nHeight:\n\n5\' 11"\n\nRelationship Status:\n\nMarried\n\nNet Worth:\n\n$9 million\n\nJoseph\'s Social Media:\n\n## Background\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Catherine Eugenia “Jean” and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. He is the oldest child in a Catholic family, with a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James. Jean was of Irish ancestry, while Joseph Sr. was of English, French, and Irish ancestry. Biden’s father had been wealthy, but suffered financial setbacks around the time Biden was born, and the family spent several years living with Biden’s maternal grandparents. During the 1950s, Scranton experienced economic decline, and Biden’s father was unable to find steady work. Beginning in 1953, when Biden was ten years old, the family resided in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before relocating to a home in nearby Mayfield. Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, keeping the family in the middle class.\n\nBiden was a standout halfback and wide receiver for Archmere Academy in Claymont. Despite being a poor student, he served as class president in his junior and senior years. He received his diploma in 1961. He briefly played freshman football at the University of Delaware. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science and a minor in English. Biden has a stutter, which he has been working on since his early twenties. He claims he reduced it by reciting poetry in front of a mirror, but some observers believe it had an impact on his performance in the Democratic Party presidential debates in 2020.\n\nBiden became the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021. He is the oldest person to hold the position, at the age of 78. He is the first man since George H. W. Bush to serve as both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president to be elected president after Richard Nixon in 1968. Due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures due to a threat of widespread civil unrest, Biden’s inauguration was “a muted affair, unlike any previous inauguration.” Biden took the Oath of Office on the west steps of the Capitol and delivered an inaugural address, but there were no spectators on the Mall and no parades or inaugural balls. Donald Trump did not attend the inauguration, making him the first outgoing president since 1869 to do so.\n\n## Career timeline\n\n1965\n\nHe Earns His Bachelor’s Degree\n\nBiden graduates from the University of Delaware in Newark with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and political science, and a minor in English.\n\n1968\n\nHe Gets a Juris Doctor\n\nBiden graduates from Syracuse University College of Law, where he ranks 76th in his class of 85, and is admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.\n\n1972\n\nHe Becomes a Junior U.S. Senator\n\nBiden defeats Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become Delaware\'s junior senator, the only Democrat willing to take on Boggs.\n\n1988\n\nHe Declares His Democratic Presidential Candidacy\n\nBiden formally declares his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination; his moderate image, speaking ability, and high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee make him a strong candidate.\n\n2008\n\nNomination for Vice President\n\nObama announces Biden as his running mate, and he is officially nominated for vice president by voice vote on August 27 at the Democratic National Convention in Denver.\n\n2021\n\nBecoming the United States President\n\nBiden is sworn in as the United States 46th president on January 20, the oldest person to hold the position, at the age of 78.\n\n## Why We Love Joe Biden\n\n1. ### He was awarded the highest civilian honor\n\n\n\nFormer President Barack Obama presented Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\'s highest civilian honor.

The law, which was included in a larger crime bill, provided $1.6 billion to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women, imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed victims to sue their attackers in civil court even if prosecutors did not pursue criminal charges.\n\n3. ### He led the National Cancer Moonshot Initiative\n\n\n\nDuring his tenure as vice president, Biden was given the authority to lead the National Cancer Moonshot Initiative in 2016. He was to act as a catalyst for cancer research by expediting discoveries, promoting greater collaboration, and making research more transparent between researchers and the public.\n\n\n## 5 Surprising Facts\n\n1. ### He is the country\'s second Catholic president\n\n\n\nBiden is the second Catholic president in American history, the first being John F.

In the [2020 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election), Biden chose [Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris) as his running mate, and they defeated [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)) incumbents [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) and [Mike Pence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence).\n\nAs president, Biden signed the [American Rescue Plan Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Rescue_Plan_Act_of_2021) in response to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States) and [subsequent recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession). He signed bipartisan bills on [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act) and [manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act). Biden proposed the [Build Back Better Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_Back_Better_Act), aspects of which were incorporated into the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act) that he signed into law in 2022. He [appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson_Supreme_Court_nomination) to the [Supreme Court of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States). In [his foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_Joe_Biden_administration), the U.S. reentered the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) and enacted the [New Atlantic Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atlantic_Charter). Biden oversaw the [complete withdrawal of U.S. troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_U.S._troop_withdrawal_from_Afghanistan) that ended the [war in Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021)), leading to [the Taliban seizing control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive). He [responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) by imposing [sanctions on Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) and authorizing [aid to Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War).

He became the first president to turn 80 years old while in office. He began his presidency with majority support, but saw his approval ratings decline significantly throughout his presidency, partially due to public frustration over [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021-2023_inflation_surge), which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 before dropping to 2.9% by the end of his presidency. Biden initially [ran for reelection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2024_presidential_campaign) and, after the [Democratic primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries), became the party\'s presumptive nominee in the [2024 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election). After his performance in the [first presidential debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Joe_Biden%E2%80%93Donald_Trump_presidential_debate), renewed scrutiny from across the political spectrum about his age and health led him to [withdraw his candidacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_Joe_Biden_from_the_2024_United_States_presidential_election). In 2022 and 2024, Biden\'s administration was [ranked favorably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#Scholar_survey_summary) by historians and scholars, diverging from [unfavorable public assessments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating) of his tenure.

[Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia), May 2019\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[\\[267\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-272) When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying "never say

"sense of duty".[\\[271\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-276)\n\n### Campaign\n\nFurther information: [2020 Democratic Party presidential

Trump.[\\[272\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-277)[\\[273\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-278)[\\[274\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-279) With Democrats keenly focused on "electability" for defeating Trump,[\\[275\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-280) this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[\\[276\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-281) It also made Biden a frequent target of

Trump was perceived by many as attempting to hurt Biden\'s chances of winning the presidency,[\\[283\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-288) resulting in [a political scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal)[\\[284\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-289) and [Trump\'s

Biden of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[\\[286\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-291) Biden had previously called himself a "tactile politician" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[\\[287\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-292) Journalist [Mark Bowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bowden) described Biden\'s lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he "doesn\'t just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer" and leaning forward to talk.[\\[288\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-The_Atlantic-293) In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more "respectful of people\'s personal

The pardon\'s sweeping extent was "unprecedented".[\\[497\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:2-511) According to [_Reason_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(magazine)) magazine, Hunter Biden\'s pardon was even more far-reaching than [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon)\'s or other "controversial"[\\[497\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:2-511) pardons:\n\n> The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but _any other criminal behavior_ since 2014—the year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter\'s job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president\'s executive powers.\n\nHunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise.[\\[498\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-512)[\\[499\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-513)[\\[59\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-NBCpardon-61) Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff.[\\[500\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-nytdec2-514) In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was "selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted", blaming "political pressure" for the collapse of a plea bargain.

Biden was regarded as a [moderate Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate_Democrat).[\\[757\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-779) As a presidential nominee, Biden\'s platform had been called the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party\'s ideological vanguard.[\\[758\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-780) Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by [Catholic social

to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, Biden represents an Americanized form of [Christian democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_democracy), taking positions characteristic of both the [center-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center-right) and [center-left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center-left).[\\[762\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Foreign_Policy-784) Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher [Jacques Maritain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Maritain), credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.[\\[763\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-785) Other analysts have likened his ideology to traditional [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States), "a doctrine of liberty, equality, justice and individual rights that relies... on a strong federal government for enforcement".[\\[764\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Greenberg-786) In 2022, journalist [Sasha Issenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_Issenberg) wrote that Biden\'s "most valuable political skill" was "an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party".[\\[765\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-787) Some critics

option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_insurance_option).[\\[775\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-797)\n\nBiden did not support national [same-sex

Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act),[\\[776\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-798) but opposed proposals for constitutional amendments that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide.[\\[777\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-799) Biden has supported same-sex marriage since

decriminalizing [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis),[\\[781\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-803) after advocating harsher penalties for drug use as a

the U.S. needs to "get tough" on China, calling it the "most serious competitor" that poses challenges to the United States\' "prosperity, security, and democratic

was born on November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1953, the Biden family moved to Delaware. Biden later graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School. In 1972, at the age of 29, he was elected to the United States Senate.1\n\nSeveral weeks after the election, Biden's wife Neilia and daughter Naomi died in a tragic car accident; their two young sons, Joseph “Beau” III and Hunter, were also seriously injured. Biden took the Oath of Office at the hospital and began commuting to Washington by train, a practice he maintained throughout his Senate career. In 1977, Biden married Jill Jacobs, and the couple raised Beau and Hunter. In 1980, they welcomed a daughter, Ashley.2\n\nAs chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden was recognized for his work on criminal justice, including the 1994 Crime Act and the Violence Against Women Act. As chairman or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He served thirty-six years in the United States Senate.3\n\nIn 2008, presidential candidate Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and they won the election that November. Vice President Biden implemented the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, led several initiatives to reduce violence against women, and initiated the “Cancer Moonshot” program after Beau’s death from brain cancer.4 On January 12, 2017, President Obama awarded Vice President Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his decades of public service.5\n\nIn 2020, Biden returned to politics to challenge and defeat President Donald J. Trump. Biden was the first president from Delaware and the second Roman Catholic president in United States history. During the campaign, Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate. Harris was the first woman, first African American, and first person of South Asian heritage to serve as Vice President of the United States.6\n\nPresident Biden’s immediate priorities included expanding relief programs and ensuring public safety with the COVID-19 pandemic, boosting the American economy, and strengthening traditional alliances. The administration worked with Congress to pass several major pieces of legislation that provided funding to improve infrastructure and high-speed internet access; invest in clean energy production; expand access to health insurance; and lower prescription drug and insulin costs.7 President Biden also made history when he nominated Kentanji Brown Jackson – the first Black woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nOn the world stage, President Biden condemned Russian aggression and supported Ukrainian resistance. He ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, ending America’s longest war but the operation and subsequent fallout were heavily criticized. In July 2024, President Biden withdrew from the presidential race and supported Vice President Harris as the nominee.\n\nSee Footnotes & Resources\n\n## Footnotes & Resources\n\n1.
